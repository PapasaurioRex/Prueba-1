  <h1>Resistors</h1>
  <p>Resistors are electronic components that resist the flow of electric current. They are essential for controlling the amount of current flowing through a circuit.</p>

  <h2>What is a Resistor?</h2>
  <p>A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. Resistors oppose the flow of electric current.</p>

  <h2>Purpose of Resistors</h2>
  <p>Resistors are used in circuits to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Limit current</li>
    <li>Divide voltage</li>
    <li>Create specific voltage drops</li>
    <li>Set time constants in circuits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Units of Resistance</h2>
  <p>The unit of resistance is the ohm (Î©). One ohm is defined as the resistance of a conductor in which a current of one ampere is produced by an applied potential difference of one volt.</p>

  <h2>Resistor Color Code</h2>

  <p>The resistor color code is a system used to indicate the resistance value of a resistor. Each color represents a specific numerical value.  </p>

  <h2>Types of Resistors</h2>
  <p>Common types of resistors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Carbon film resistors</li>
    <li>Wire-wound resistors</li>
    <li>Metal film resistors</li>
    <li>Surface-mount resistors</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
  <p>Ohm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it, and the proportionality constant is the resistance (R). This can be represented by the formula: V = IR.</p>

  <h2>Examples of Resistors in Real-World Applications</h2>
  <p>Resistors are used in a wide variety of applications, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Electronic circuits</li>
    <li>Sensors</li>
    <li>Power supplies</li>
    <li>Audio amplifiers</li>
  </ul>
